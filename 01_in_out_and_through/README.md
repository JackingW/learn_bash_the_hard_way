# In, Out and Though
Two of the commands we used in previous chapter,are workhorses of the shell scripterâ€™s stable: echo and printf. Both are bash builtin commands. Both print information to the standard output stream, and both have cons and pros.
In this chapter we'll go though them and try to explain why `printf` is more powerful and why  `echo` has problems.

## Paramenters and Variables

*_Definition_*: A **parameter** is an entity that stores values.

There are 3 main types of parameters: 
- Positional parameters: arguments that present on cli and they are refered by a number.
- Special parameters: set by the shell to store information about aspects of its own state, e.g. exit status of previous command.
- Variables: are sets of memory cell that can store data defined by user(you).

Lets dive into these 3 types little bit more:

### Positional Parameters

The arguments on the command line are available to a shell program as numberedparameters. The first argument is $1, the second is $2, and so on, until you get to $10, in which case you'll have to group those with curly braces {}.

what are the practical use cases ? here is an example:

write a script called `hello`,(you can copy/pasta it from previous script)

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Description: print Hello and the first command-line argument

printf "Hello, %s!\n" "$1"
```
and when ever you will run the script with an argument, it will respond with the output:

```
[que@core]$ hello Alex
Hello, Alex!

[que@core]$ hello Johnny
Hello, Johnny!
```

The script is passed to the parameters that can be accessed via their positions, $0, $1,$2 and so on. The function shift N moves the positional parameters by N positions, ifyou ran shift (the default value of N is 1), then $0 would be discarded, $1 wouldbecome $0, $2 would become $1, and so on: they would all be shifted by 1 position. for example: if we'll take the same  `hello` script and add  shift to it the values will print out in different order:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Description: print Hello and the first command-line argument

shift 
printf "Hello, %s!\n" "$1"
```
here comes the output:
```
[que@core]$ hello Johnny Alex
Hello, Alex!
```
