# In, Out and Though
Two of the commands we used in previous chapter,are workhorses of the shell scripterâ€™s stable: echo and printf. Both are bash builtin commands. Both print information to the standard output stream, and both have cons and pros.
In this chapter we'll go though them and try to explain why `printf` is more powerful and why  `echo` has problems.
