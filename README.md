# Welcome
Hope i find you in well and hope that you came accross this books in wondering and seeking for your need to learn and embrace wonderful things about Shell/Bash scripting on Unix and Linux based operational systems.

Below here are the chapter names of the book that i've been trying to developer for over the decade:

- [Chapter 0](00_hello_world/README.md)
- [Chapter 1](01_in_out_and_through/README.md)
- [Chapter 2](02_looping_and_branching/README.md)
- [Chapter 3](03_cmd_parsing_and_parsing/README.md)
- [Chapter 4](04_parameters_and_variables/README.md)
- [Chapter 5](05_functions/README.md)
- [Chapter 6](06_string_manipulation/README.md)
- [Chapter 7](07_file_operations_and_cmds/README.md)
- [Chapter 8](08_reserved_words_and_builtins/README.md)
- [Chapter 9](09_writing_bug_free/README.md)
- [Chapter 10](10_programming_for_the_cmd/README.md)
- [Chapter 11](11_runtime_conf/README.md)
- [Chapter 12](12_data_processing/README.md)
- [Chapter 13](13_scripting_the_screen/README.md)
- [Chapter 14](14_entry_level_programming/README.md)

Within these chapters,that will change and get update as time will flow, I'll try to give more pragmatic way to learn and practice the shell hard way.
- But why the hard way?
  
Well the term was created by my favority author named [Zed A. Shaw](https://learncodethehardway.com), by claiming that the hard way is the only way, that is effective to learning programming, I could not have agreed more with him. Yet, I don't agree with him on all term, hence in this book, i'll be trying to emphesize the things that i think are important, and hopefully with your help, i'll be able to develop a book that will be interesting, educational,
