# Conditionas and Loops that come with it

## Before all the tools

### Exit Status

In previous chapter we talked about [Special Character](../Exercises/01_in_out_and_through/README.md)


At the heart of any programming language are `condition check`  and `loop iteration` execution. 

- Loop iteration is the repetition of a section of code until a condition changes.
- Condition check execution is making a choice between two or more actions, one of which may be to do nothing, based on a condition.
 
In the shell, there are three types of loop:

- `while CONDITION;do ;done`
- `until CONDITION;do; done`
- `for iterators in DATA; do  ;done`

There several types of conditional execution: 

- `if then fi`
- `case esac`
- `&&` and `||` which mean logical AND and logical OR operators.
  
With the exception of for and case, the exit status of acommand controls the behavior.
